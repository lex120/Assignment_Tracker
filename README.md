```

## Core Classes

### `Cls`

**Handles:** one class and its assignments

**Attributes:**

- name
- file_name
- assignment_list

**Important Methods:**

- `open_class()` – loads assignments from CSV  
- `add(assignment)` – adds new assignment  
- `save_class()` – writes assignments to CSV  

---

### `Assignment`

**Represents:** a single assignment

**Attributes:**

- status
- name
- due_date_string
- due_time
- type_of_assignment
- description
- days_until_due

**Internal Methods:**

- `parse_date()` — converts string → date  
- `compute_days_until_due()` — recalculates based on today
